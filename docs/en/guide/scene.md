# Application Scenarios

`fluth` is suitable for reactive programming scenarios. Compared to reactive data, organizing code using streams has the following advantages:

- More declarative programming paradigm, greatly reducing code volume
- Easier to build data-driven code compared to reactive data
- Easier code readability, with clear upstream and downstream relationships
